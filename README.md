# Flappy Bird AI using NEAT

This project implements the classic Flappy Bird game using Python's Pygame library and utilizes NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) to create an AI model that learns to play the game.

## Overview

The code consists of:

- **Flappy Bird Game**: Implemented using Pygame.
- **NEAT Implementation**: AI model trained with NEAT to play the game autonomously.

## Installation

To run the project, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Pygame
- NEAT Python library

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    https://github.com/khmorad/flappy_bird_neural_network
    python flappy_bird_ai.py
